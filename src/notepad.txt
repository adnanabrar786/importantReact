*) Introducing JSX
JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension to JavaScript 
 that allows you to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript code.
 It is commonly used in React, a JavaScript library
 for building user interfaces.

*)  Rendering Elements
In React, rendering elements refers to the process of creating and displaying 
UI components on the screen. React provides a declarative approach to building
 user interfaces, where you define how your UI should look based on the current 
state of your application, and React takes care of efficiently updating 
the actual DOM (Document Object Model) to reflect those changes.


*) State and Lifecycle

componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)
